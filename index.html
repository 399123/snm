				<h2>This Site</h2>
				<p>This site is meant to be used as a way to experience something yourself. While I will present my viewpoints, there will be excerpts and video from <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>. Please use these to form an opinion on your own as well.</p>
				<p>Watching or reading a play can be quite an experience. It can get you involved, present characters in a way that allows for learning, identification, and empathy with the character. Plays can be as much a vehicle to learn new things and learn lessons as any folk story or novel. And the expierience gained from them varies greatly based on if you watch or read them. The way to read this site is easily explained. On both pages, there will be 2 columns of paragraphs, followed by a combined section underneath. The paragraph section are the differences, and the combined section is what is similar. There will be a video to watch, and the same segment as text. I would reccommend starting with the text side.</p>
