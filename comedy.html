				<p>The scene below comes from <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>. It is a comedy written 
				by Shakespeare about 3 men, each trying to woo Bianca. The problem was that Bianca's father will not marry Bianca until his eldest daughter, Katherine is married. The scene above is near the end of the play, when Everyone is gathering up again. The end result, is that they end up comparing wives, and Katherine the "Shrew" is actually a wonderful wife, tamed with kindness.</p>

						<p>Enter <b>BAPTISTA</b>, <b>VINCENTIO</b>, <b>GREMIO</b>, the <b>MERCHANT</b>, <b>LUCENTIO</b>, <b>BIANCA</b>, <b>PETRUCHIO</b>, <b>KATHERINE</b>, <b>HORTENSIO</b>, <b>WIDOW</b>, <b>TRANIO</b>, <b>BIONDELLO</b>, and <b>GRUMIO</b>, with the Servingmen bringing in a banquet</p>
						<p><b>LUCENTIO</b>:
							<p>At last, though long, our jarring notes agree,</p>
							<p>And time it is when raging war is done</p>
							<p>To smile at â€™scapes and perils overblown.</p>
							<p>My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,</p>
							<p>While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine.</p>
							<p>Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,</p>
							<p>And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,</p>
							<p>Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.</p>
							<p>My banquet is to close our stomachs up,</p>
							<p>After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down,</p>
							<p>For now we sit to chat as well as eat.</p>
						<p><b>PETRUCHIO</b>:</p>
							<p>Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!</p>
						<p><b>BAPTISTA</b>:</p>
							<p>Padua affords this kindness, son Petruccio</p>
						<p><b>PETRUCCIO</b>:</p>
							<p>Padua affords nothing but what is kind.</p>
						<p><b>HORTENSIO</b>:</p>
							<p>For both our sakes, I would that word were true.</p>
						<p>The above are the opening lines from act 5 scene 2. In these Shakespeare does a great job of making the audinece laugh. When Petruchio says, "Nothing but sit and sit, eat and eat!", He is saying that all they do is sit and eat. Meaning that their lives together consist of not much besides, sitting, eating, and talking.</p>
						<p>Now in reading this segment, there are a few things to notice. For one, there is not much language describing the scene, Lucentio's house, or anything else. This holds true for all of Shakespeare's plays, and actually scenery was not used at the Globe Theatre.</p>
						<p>Also in reading a comedy, people will often make fun of or crazy situations will be seen in the play. These still come without too many descriptors, allowing what happens to be left open to the reader or actor who play's the part. Shakespeare does a lot with comedy that is now lost on us, so while we may not be laughing to hard at his jokes, the audience back in his time were.</p>
						<p>When reading a play, energy will vary greatly by person. As for me, I am not a huge fan of reading plays, and because of this I find that I do not put a huge amount of energy into the task, making the play feel dull and slow. How much you decide to put into reading the play, making sure you understand the jokes, relaxing and enjoying the play without providing appropriate energy will directly impact the way you percieve the play</p>

						<p>The thing about watching a play is that there are a few ways that it can be done. One way is faithfully, as in the above scene, which allows for the viewer to watch the play as Shakespeare origionally wrote it. There have also been various people that have made more modernized versions of the play, allowing the play to be more relevant to a modern audience.</p>
						<p>Watching a play is that it is different from reading a play. One easy and big one is that the images are provided, and the reader does not have to worry about imagining them. But even in this, there are differences between now and Shakespeare's time. Once again we look at can look at an easily huge differenece between modern and Shakespeare's time. That is, Shakespeare did not use props in his plays. Instead the audience would provide the image. Because of this, watching a play is quite different now than back then.</p>
						<p>When watching a play one can be in 2 situations. One can be in a playhouse or at some other theatre, with people watching the play together, or they can be alone, watching it on some sort of screeen typically. These can elicit 2 different reactions from people watching the same play. Watching a play in a playhouse allows for the viewer to feel the energy in the room, as well as people almost giving cues as to what is funny. When watching alone on a screen of some sort, you have to provide more of the energy that would be provided by actors and the rest of the audience to get the same feel. As such, one would be able to have a very different experience just from choosing where to watch their play.</p>

			<p>The fact that our sense of humor, and what various words mean has changed so much, can greatly impact the reading of a comedy. Shakespeare's comedies rely on his era's wit. This has the potential to cause a very interesting disconnect with modern people. We will not understand his jokes, so reading or watching a Shakesperean Comedy can be a dull task, as we just watch the story unfold. In a way, us modern people will never be able to watch Shakespeare as he intended, understanding all of the jokes inherently and not having to wonder about their meaning.</p>
			<p>Another similarity between reading and watching is that, at least in Shakespeare's time, there was not much description of the scenes, and minimal on the actions. This served 2 major purposes, one was to let the actor interpret the action, and do as he thinks the character should do, the other is that Shakespeare and other acting companies in that time did not use props, or even much of anything besides a stage and clothes. In the case of the globe, there was a second floor balcony, allowing things like Juliet's solliloquy on the balcony while Romeo is beneath it to be performed as it sounds.</p>
