					<p>Enter King <b>CLAUDIUS</b>, Queen <b>GERTRUDE</b>, <b>LAERTES</b>, <b>OSRIC</b>, lords, and other attendants with trumpets, drums, foils, a table, and flagons of wine</p>
					<p><b>CLAUDIUS:</b></p>
						<p>Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. (puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's)</p>
					<p><b>HAMLET:</b>
						<p>Give me your pardon, sir. I’ve done you wrong.</p>
						<p>But pardon ’t, as you are a gentleman.</p>
						<p>This presence knows,</p>
						<p>And you must needs have heard, how I am punished</p>
						<p>With sore distraction. What I have done,</p>
						<p>That might your nature, honor, and exception</p>
						<p>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.</p>
						<p>Was ’t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.</p>
						<p>If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,</p>
						<p>And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,</p>
						<p>Then Hamlet does it not. Hamlet denies it.</p>
						<p>Who does it, then? His madness. If’t be so,</p>
						<p>Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged.</p>
						<p>His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.</p>
						<p>Sir, in this audience,</p>
					<p>When reading a tragedy, the  reader does not have all of the frills that a on stage production would have. The reader instead gets just the words, and is free to draw their own meaning from them. The reader is free to experience the full effect of the tragedy, without any interpretation. In a well written play like <i>Hamlet</i>, the reader can experience Hamlet's feelings, and emotions as raw as Shakespeare intended. From his mother dying, to his hatred of his uncle, to his internal strife, even when he was about to kill his uncle while he was praying. This raw emotion is lost sometimes when a scene is acted out.</p>
					<p>Shakespeare does not assign his actors positions or other things of that nature. Because of that when reading it can be hard to determine where people are. Lets do a little excersise, we are staging the scene given above, when Hamlet and Laertes have their fencing match. You are the director of a live stage. Hoe do you position everybody. Do you have the king and queen sitting on raised thrones, or standing and watching. Where are the servants and attendants? Without a visual scene, all of these things must be determined by the reader, and with a direct impact on how everything goes together. The positions, actions, body-language are all determined by what the reader feels is right.</p>

					<p>When watching a tragedy like this, some things stand out as different from reading a tragedy. When watching a tragedy, the general feel of it is tending towards a sad nature. Shakespeare as always does not put much description into how things go down in this scene. The interesting thing is that while Shakespeare does not provide specific scene cues, the director does an excellent job of injecting comedy into the scene. By having Hamlet and Laertes run around getting everyone in a flummox while the queen fades and dies from the poisoned cup, there is a nice piece of humor in a scene that otherwisegs would be tragic and quite a saddening scene. The levity is an excellent contrast to a sad and dour scene.</p>
					<p>Another difference between watching and reading a play is the way that the director interprets the scene. The director get's free reign over the way in which he displays the scene. By gaining free reign because of Shakespeare's and the periods writing style, the interpretation is very open.</p>

			<p>There are some similarities between watching and reading a tragedy. The effect, while in some cases lessened by seeing the play performed, can still show the in depth feelings and turmoil of Hamlet. A person can learn a lot from just reading a few simple words, or watching a few minutes of video. Hamlet does an excellent job in the scene above, whether David Tennant's lighthearted performance, or when he says, </p>
			<p>"Give me your pardon, sir. I’ve done you wrong.</p>
			<p>But pardon ’t, as you are a gentleman.</p>
			<p>This presence knows,"</p>
			<p>In this scene, Hamlet is lamenting over a percieved wrong, and asking for forgiveness. This is immediately before his fencing, and everyone's death. While from the short segment, not as much is learned, Hamlet does an excellent job of finally showing that his internal strife is through, and he is ready to act.</p>
